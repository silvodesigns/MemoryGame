# Memory Game Project

This is my memory game project that I am currently working on. The project belongs to the Front-End Developer course.  In this project , I have to make heavy use of JavaScript in order to manipulate the DOM in order to create a game.


# In order to play 

just click the card to reveal the Pokeballs
you win the game when all game cards have been matched


note: game is playable, but I am still working on  fixing minor bugs
