#Pokeball Matching Game

This is my memory game project that I am currently working on. The project belongs to the Front-End Developer course.  In this project , I have to make heavy use of JavaScript in order to manipulate the DOM in order to create a game. I have customized the game with my own images and visual language.

# In order to play 

When you first load the play, you will encounter the welcome screen.
Click the play button in order to beging the game.
As soon as you click the play button, the cards will be displayed on the screen and a timer will begin to count.
You can play the game by just clicking on any of the cards.

# In order to win

The goal of the game is to match all the cards.
The less time you spend while trying to match them all the better score you will get.
The score system is based on three stars.
Time and the amount of click you made are taken into considerartion.

note: game is playable, but I am still working on  fixing minor bugs
