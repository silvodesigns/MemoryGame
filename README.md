# Pokeball Matching Game :+1:

This is my memory game project that I am currently working on. The project belongs to the Front-End Developer course.  In this project , I have to make heavy use of JavaScript in order to manipulate the DOM in order to create a game. I have customized the game with my own images and visual language.

# In order to play 

* When you first load the play, you will encounter the welcome screen.<br>
* Click the play button in order to beging the game.<br>
* As soon as you click the play button, the cards will be displayed on the screen and a timer will begin to count.<br>
* You can play the game by just clicking on any of the cards.<br>

# In order to win

* The goal of the game is to match all the cards.<br>
* The less time you spend while trying to match them all the better score you will get.<br>
* The score system is based on three stars.<br>
* Time and the amount of click you made are taken into considerartion.<br>

note: game is playable, but I am still working on  fixing minor bugs
